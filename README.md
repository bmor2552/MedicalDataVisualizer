# MedicalDataVisualizer
**The Goal:** For this challenge I will be deminstarting the knowledge of the following libraries:  matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. 

# The Challenge
In this challenge I will be visualizing and making calculations from medical examination data. In the challenge I am provided an example of how the visulized data should appear once displayed. See the follwoing link for the full description of the free code camp challenge: https://repl.it/@freeCodeCamp/fcc-medical-data-visualizer#README.md 

# The Process
1. Read and understand the task being asked
2. Break the problem down in to  smaller problems to tackle
3. Put it all together

Note that the data provided is already cleaned, the process listed above is not what you would typically see in a Data Science project.
